# Inter Process Communication (IPC) UDF for AutoIt

This is a UDF (User defined functions) library for AutoIt, providing a simple way to start sub processes and communicate with them.

The UDF can be used to detect, if the script is started as a sub process by the main process and start the corresponding routines.
The UDF also provides the ability to send commands as well as data between the main and the sub process.

The IPC-Example files showcase different ways to use the UDF.
The only required file to be included in the script is the "IPC.au3".
