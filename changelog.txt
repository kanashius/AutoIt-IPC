Version 1.0.0
- release of the first version
Version 1.1.0
- seperated __IPC_MainSend into __IPC_MainSend for data and __IPC_MainSendCmd for commands
- seperated __IPC_SubSend into __IPC_SubSend for data and __IPC_SubSendCmd for commands
- when sending data/commands, up to 10 parameters can be added. To send more, put them in other datatypes (e.g. arrays) for sending
- the receiving callbacks now have a $iCmd and $arData parameter with $arData having as many elements as data parameters used with the send methods
- it is now possible to sent any autoit data type directly (They are automatically converted to send over tcp and then converted back)
  (except currently Object (ObjCreate) and DllStructs (DllStructCreate), still looking into that)
